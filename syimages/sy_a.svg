<!-- Syllabics "a" -->

<!-- Note 1:

	 We spell out the paths laboriously instead of
	 something like:
		<path d = "M 25 50 L 68 25 L 68 75 Z"
	 This is necessary because of some flaw that causes the Z
	 that closes the path not to be done and/or the line caps
	 not to be rounded. Spelling it out makes all the commands
	 recognized.
	 
	 Note 2:
	 
	 We draw the paths in the most convenient order for making
	 these files (i.e. to make them as regular and similar as
	 possible). Not in the order that they might be written by
	 hand.
